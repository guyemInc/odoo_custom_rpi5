Or, instead, in case of a breakage (like me), use online installation when the raspberry starts

See guideline here : https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html

Allow ssh access and register local IP access to configure/verify your rpi via another terminal

```

# Odoo 16 installation

# Purchase installation

You should now be able to access the Odoo login page from a browser at http://{ip address}:8069. You can use http://localhost:8069 7 if you donâ€™t know the IP address. You should be able to get the IP address using this command on the Pi:

```
ifconfig
```
From there, you will be asked to set various authentication credentials such as Master Password and Database Name. Be sure to store or write them down as they are critical later on.

Configure your Odoo database : bdd name, password, email, language

Refresh your browser page and see login page to your own Odoo  

Continue with your own configuration. Here as an example

# Open Office
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

# Visual Studio Code installation

See here to install : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/raspberry-pi
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

If VS Code is too slow, try this :
VS Code on Raspberry Pi 4 may be slow with the default setup. A workaround is to disable hardware (GPU) acceleration in VS Code:

    Open the VS Code argv.json file using the Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments command.
    Set "disable-hardware-acceleration": true.
    Restart VS Code.

The "disable-hardware-acceleration": true runtime argument switch has the effect of passing the --disable-gpu command-line argument on VS Code startup.
